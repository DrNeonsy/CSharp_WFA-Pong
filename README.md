## Idea
Windows Form Apps Are Quite Simple When It Comes To Realizing Small Applications.
With Basic C# Knowledge And A Bit Of Research, I Was Thinking About Whether Or Not Pong Could Be A Possibility Within The Spectrum Of What Windows Apps Can Offer.
So I Tried And This Is The Result.

## Note
I Wanted To Add A Background Image And Make It Look A Bit Nicer But It Caused Lags Which I Couldn't Figure Out Fast Enough.
Truth Be Told, I Did Not Want To Put Too Much Time Into This Because It Is Merely An Experiment.
Otherwise I Would've Added Audio Effects On Bounce As Well.
So In The End I Went For A More Classic Look Which You Can See In The [Demo](#demo).

## How To Use

- P1 | Left Side Player
  - (W) Move Up
  - (S) Move Down

- P2
  - (ðŸ”¼) Move Up
  - (ðŸ”½) Move Down
- MISC
  - (ESC) Exit Application
  - (SPACE) Toggle Pause

The Game Will Probably End When Either Sides Reaches A Score Of 99

## Bug
If You Time It Right You Can Get The Pong Ball Inside A Player By Moving Towards It While It Is On The Same Horizontal Axis.
